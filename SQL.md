### **1. SQL Fundamentals**
Begin with the basics of SQL to understand how to interact with databases.

#### **Topics Covered:**
- **Database Basics:**
  - What is a database? Relational vs. Non-relational databases.
  - Overview of popular relational database systems (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server).
- **Core SQL Commands:**
  - `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE` for querying data.
  - `INSERT INTO`, `VALUES` for adding data.
  - `UPDATE`, `SET`, and `DELETE` for modifying data.
- **Filtering and Sorting:**
  - `ORDER BY` for sorting results.
  - `LIMIT` or `TOP` for restricting rows.
  - `DISTINCT` to eliminate duplicates.
- **Basic Functions:**
  - Aggregates: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`.

#### **Key Skills:**
- Retrieving and filtering data.
- Performing basic data modifications.
- Sorting and aggregating query results.

#### **Projects:**
1. **Employee Directory:** Create and query a database of employees with names, roles, and departments.
2. **Sales Data Report:** Analyze a sales dataset to calculate total revenue and average sales per transaction.

### **2. Intermediate SQL**
Expand your skills with more advanced query techniques and database structures.

#### **Topics Covered:**
- **Joins:**
  - Inner Join, Left Join, Right Join, Full Outer Join.
  - Combining data from multiple tables using foreign keys.
- **Subqueries:**
  - Inline subqueries in `SELECT`.
  - Correlated subqueries for dynamic filtering.
- **Grouping Data:**
  - `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions.
  - Filtering groups with `HAVING`.
- **Data Types and Constraints:**
  - Common data types (`INT`, `VARCHAR`, `DATE`, etc.).
  - Constraints (`PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `NOT NULL`).
- **Basic Indexing:**
  - Creating and using indexes to optimize query performance.

#### **Key Skills:**
- Writing multi-table queries using joins and subqueries.
- Structuring databases with keys and constraints.
- Improving query performance with indexing.

#### **Projects:**
1. **Library Management System:** Manage books, members, and borrow records using multiple related tables.

Dive into more complex concepts and database management.

#### **Topics Covered:**
- **Advanced Joins and Set Operations:**
  - Self Joins for hierarchical data.
  - Set operations: `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`.
- **Window Functions:**
  - Using `OVER()` for ranking (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`).
  - Running totals and moving averages.
- **Transactions and ACID Properties:**
  - `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`.
  - Ensuring data consistency with transactions.
- **Views, Functions, and Procedures:**
  - Creating reusable views.
  - Writing user-defined functions (UDFs).
  - Stored procedures for batch operations.
- **Database Administration:**
  - Backup and restore operations.
  - Granting and revoking permissions.
