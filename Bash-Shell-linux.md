  - File manipulation (`mv`, `cp`, `find`, `touch`, `basename`, `dirname`).
  - Reading files line-by-line in a script.
- **Linux Tools for Scripting:**
  - `cut`, `sort`, `uniq` for data processing.
  - `xargs` for command chaining.
  - `diff` and `cmp` for file comparison.
- **Basic Networking:**
  - Using `ping`, `curl`, and `wget` in scripts.
  - Displaying network configuration with `ifconfig` or `ip`.

#### **Key Skills:**
- Writing modular scripts using functions.
- Processing and manipulating text data efficiently.
- Automating tasks with file and network commands.
